# Wave Portal

Hosted at https://waveportal-starter-project.philiplu97.repl.co.

Current contract address: 0x4d5054B5D5005F2AC24Faa22D0351Bd615fcAa2F (https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x4d5054B5D5005F2AC24Faa22D0351Bd615fcAa2F)

Did a beginner's project to get accustomed to React, Javascript, and Solidity. Users can connect their Ethereum wallets (on the Rinkeby test network) through MetaMask and "wave" at me with a message, which creates a visible record of the waver's address, message, the time they waved at, and the "prize" amount they won (30% chance to win some free fake ETH ;D). Requires the user to have Rinkeby network ETH in their wallet to pay for gas. Any user can get ETH from this faucet: https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby.

If anyone sees this, feel free to wave at me if the website's still up :).
